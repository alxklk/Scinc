# Scinc

(pronounced as \[stsÉªnk\])

_Skinks are lizards belonging to the family Scincidae and the infraorder Scincomorpha._
_(Wikipedia)_

Small and simple statically strong typed embeddable interpreted programming language.

Syntactical and semantical subset of C++. Can be embedded in another applications or run by interpreter. Scinc program is correct C++ program and thus can be compiled into native code without changes.

Current VM realization runs on own virtual processor and virtual address space. Speed is about 9-11 host CPU clock cycle per VM opcode. On modern 4.5 GHz desktop CPU it is ~500 million vm opcodes per second.

## Motivation

Scinc is intended to be used as a script embeddable language for high level application logic and for rapid functionality prototyping, with possibility to convert it into C++ with minimal effort.

Language itself is intended to be reasonably limited subset of C++, moving towards better compatibility with standard compilers. Constantly growing set of minimal feature tests is used to check it after all changes in lexer, parser, backend or VM. There are the reasons, why C++ was choosen:

* author knows C++ well enough
* there are a lot of editors/IDEs that support C++
* standard language with competing compilers allows easy and reliable tests: just compile test program with G++/Clang/MSVC and compare output stringwise
* no version compatibility questions: new versions of Scinc will be more and more compatible with C++ _(hopefully)_

## Language features and description

### So far, these base data types are supported:

Name|example|meaning
----|-------|----
`char`|`'a'`, `"12345"`|1 byte character. Single char literal implicitly converted to int, string literal "123456" is stored in constant segment, implicitly terminated with `'\0'` and converted to `char*` pointer to 0th element
`int`|`3`, `0xff`|signed integer, underlying type is default 32 bit signed int
`float`|`3.14`, `.5f`, `-1.5e+3`|IEEE float. Underlying native type is `double`, so, `sizeof(float)` equals `8` in Scinc

Arrays with compile time known sizes, structs, classes, pointers and references can be used to extend types. Struct can contain arrays or other structs, array can contain structs.

Major type conversions between base types are supported, however, they can cause extra operations and sometimes buggy or missing. It is known issue and author works on fixes and improvements

`struct`, `class` correspond to their C++ analogs. For now, there are some limitations:
* no bit fields
* no constructors and destructors
* members access (`public:`, `private:`, `protected:`) ignored, `const` is ignored too
* user defined overloaded operators don't support freestanding implementation yet
* `operator[]` and `operator->` cannot be overloaded for now

Function member can be declared as `static` and then called with namespace resolution operator `::`.

Variable declarations support only one variable at a time: `int a; int b;` is OK, `int a,b;` will cause an error.

Global variables can not be initialized.

Local variable declarations support initialization, arrays can be initialized with initialization lists: `int x[3]={1,2,3};`, missing items are implicitly 0. Be aware of the fact, that list is stored in constant segment and event empty list will occupy space, for example, `int x[4]={};` will be compiled into 4*sizeof(int) zero bytes.

Pointer and references are supported, but their usage in variable declarations is limited to one at a time, i.e. `int * ptrx;` is OK, `int ** ptrptrx;` is not.

## Preprocessor

Preprocessor supports object-style and function-style macros, `__SCINC__` macro is defined, can be useful if someone needs conditional compilation

`#include <...>` is ignored, `#include "..."` works, but only in current folder. Some include directives can be handled separatedly, for example, `#include "graphics.h"` will not cause compiler to for this file in current folder, instead graphic window will be created and some bindings to native functions will be made.

## Error messages

Error messages are sometimes confusing or missing, sometimes extra.

## Dynamic linking

It is relatively easy to link function from shared library (.dll on Windows, .so on Unix-like), see examples/dynamic_native

## Javascript Backend (experimental)

There is experimental JS backend. VM bytecode is transformed into simplified Javascript and saved into `code.js` file. Web Runtime library ([webRT](webRT) folder content) should be in same folder. Code can be executed in browser by openint [index.html](webRT/index.html).

## Runtime library

Interpreter has some bindings to native functions, some kind of runtime library. This is not a part of the language and provided as an example. Can (and probably will) be changed in future.
